## üéØ How to run?
```
1. The data folder stores various associations and similarities. 
2. The My_code folder for implementing the MAHN model, which specifically includes:
  (1) main.py is used to start the MAHN model and set up parameters.
  (2) train.py is used to implement training and validation, loss function definition, optimizer selection and parameter update.
  (3) model.py is used to build the overall structure of the MAHN model, including different meta-path encoding and bilinear decoder.
  (4) layers.py mainly stores some customized network layers, including multi-head attention layer, semantic level and node level attention layer, etc.
  (5) utils.py mainly realizes data loading, semantic network construction, node sampling and evaluation index calculation, etc.
